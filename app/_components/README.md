# Components Organization

This folder contains all React components organized by category for better maintainability and developer experience.

```

## Usage

### Import from Category Folders
```typescript
// Import specific components from categories
import { AuthProvider, LoginButton } from '@/app/_components/auth'
import { Navigation, ProductCard } from '@/app/_components/ui'
import { Calculator } from '@/app/_components/features'
import { StripeCheckout } from '@/app/_components/payment'
```

### Import from Main Barrel
```typescript
// Import everything from main barrel (less recommended for large apps)
import { AuthProvider, Navigation, Calculator } from '@/app/_components'
```

## Component Categories

### Auth Components (`/auth`)
- **AuthProvider**: Wraps app with NextAuth session provider
- **LoginButton**: Handles Google OAuth login/logout with user display
- **UserInfo**: Shows user account details and access level

### UI Components (`/ui`)
- **Navigation**: Main navigation bar with auth-aware menu items
- **ProductCard**: Reusable card for displaying product/subscription tiers
- **PageStates**: Loading states, auth required messages, and access notices

### Feature Components (`/features`)
- **Calculator**: Feature-rich calculator with tiered functionality based on user access level

### Payment Components (`/payment`)
- **StripeCheckout**: Embedded Stripe checkout form following Stripe's best practices

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Components are grouped by their primary purpose
2. **Easy Navigation**: Developers can quickly find components by category
3. **Scalable Structure**: New components can be easily added to appropriate categories
4. **Clean Imports**: Barrel exports provide clean, organized import statements
5. **Better Maintainability**: Related components are co-located for easier maintenance

## Adding New Components

1. **Determine the Category**: Choose the most appropriate folder based on the component's primary purpose
2. **Create the Component**: Add your new component file to the chosen folder
3. **Update Barrel Exports**: Add the export to the category's `index.ts` file
4. **Update Main Barrel**: The main `index.ts` already re-exports all categories

## Migration Notes

All existing imports have been updated to use the new structure. The reorganization maintains full backward compatibility through barrel exports while providing a cleaner, more maintainable codebase structure.
